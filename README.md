# MindBank

Keep What Inspires You

MindBank is a simple way to capture and organize the quotes, ideas, and words that move you—whether they come from a book, a podcast, or just a thought that pops into your head. Just say it out loud or type it in, and MindBank takes care of the rest.

No complicated tagging. No clutter. MindBank uses Google Gemini AI to do the heavy lifting for sorting and context:
- Say a single word? The app finds its definition, origin, and example uses.
- Share a phrase or a memorable quote? MindBank will guess who said it, and offer relevant context or insight.

## Features

- 🧠 **Smart AI Sorting:** MindBank figures out if you’re sharing a new word or a favorite quote, so you don’t have to organize.
- 📚 **Lexicon & Quotebook:** Your saved words go into a personal dictionary; inspiring lines and passages fill your quote book.
- ☁️ **Always Synced:** Everything is stored in the cloud (Firebase), so your thoughts are safe and available wherever you are.
